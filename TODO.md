## What things to do

- TODO Move OS stuff from .h to .cpp file and abstract all
- TODO ccode needs to generate visual studio projects and tundra files that compile a Windowed Application and NOT a Console.
- TODO event queue update (rename to pump) and push (should be push(Event& e)) functions move to window_xxx.cpp since they have
       OS related functions and types.
